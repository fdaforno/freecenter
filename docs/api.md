# REST API

Everything the web console does goes through this API. All paths are under `/api/v1` and, except for the login, need the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"..."}' | jq -r .token)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hosts
```

A token expires after 7 days without use. Errors are returned as `{"error": "..."}` with a matching HTTP status. Users with the read-only role can call every `GET` (and the queries listed as such below), nothing else.

Long operations (migration, clone, backup, restore) answer `202` with a **job**: poll `GET /jobs/{id}` until its `status` is `ok` or `error`.

Every modifying request is recorded in Recent Tasks. A client can label its requests with the headers `X-Task-Name` and `X-Task-Target` (URL-encoded).

## Session and users

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/login` | `{username,password}` → token, role |
| GET | `/auth/oidc/login` | redirect to the OIDC provider's authorization endpoint (no token needed) |
| GET | `/auth/oidc/callback` | OIDC redirect target: exchanges the code, creates/links a local user, issues a session token |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | ends the session |
| GET | `/auth/me` | current user |
| POST | `/auth/password` | `{current,new}`: change one's own password |
| GET, POST | `/users` | list / create users (`{username,password,role}`); administrators only |
| PUT, DELETE | `/users/{id}` | change role or password / delete |

### OIDC configuration and roles (administrators only)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/oidc/config` | current OIDC configuration (client secret never returned) |
| PUT | `/oidc/config` | `{enabled,issuer,client_id,client_secret,scopes[],claim_name,group_roles{},default_role}` — save; empty secret keeps the existing one |
| GET | `/roles` | all role definitions with their permissions |
| POST | `/roles` | create a custom role `{name,description,manage_vms,manage_hosts,manage_storage,manage_users,console_access}` |
| PUT | `/roles/{id}` | replace a role (built-in roles can be edited but not deleted) |
| DELETE | `/roles/{id}` | delete a custom role (built-in roles are protected) |

Permissions are checked on every mutating request: a user needs `manage_vms` for VM lifecycle, `manage_hosts` for host configuration, `manage_storage` for file uploads and ISO downloads, `manage_users` for user and role management, and `console_access` for the VM console. The built-in `admin` role has all permissions; `readonly` has none.

## Virtual machines

| POST | `/hosts/{hid}/vms/register` | `{datastore,path}`: add to the inventory a machine that already exists on a datastore, from its `.vmx` file |
| GET, PUT, DELETE | `/hosts/{hid}/vms/{vmid}` | details / change settings / delete (`?delete_files=false` to only unregister) |
| POST | `/hosts/{hid}/vms/{vmid}/power` | `{action:"on"\|"off"\|"reset"\|"suspend"\|"shutdown_guest"\|"reboot_guest"}` |

Creating a virtual machine:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hosts/$HID/vms \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "web-01", "guest_id": "ubuntu64Guest",
    "num_cpus": 2, "memory_mb": 4096,
    "datastore": "datastore1", "disks": [{"size_gb": 16, "thin": true}],
    "network": "VM Network", "adapter_type": "vmxnet3",
    "power_on": true
  }'
```

With `"cloud_image": "cloud-images/rocky-9.vmdk"` the boot disk is cloned from that image, and an optional `cloud_init` object (`hostname`, `users`, `ssh_authorized_keys`, `packages`, `runcmd`, `write_files`, `network_config`, or a raw `user_data`) configures the guest on first boot.

Fields of `PUT /hosts/{hid}/vms/{vmid}`. All are optional and only what is present is applied; the machine must be powered off.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `num_cpus`, `cores_per_socket`, `memory_mb`, `annotation` | CPU, memory, notes |
| `name`, `guest_id` | display name (files are not renamed), guest OS |
| `firmware` (`bios`\|`efi`), `boot_delay_ms`, `enter_bios_setup` | boot options |
| `cpu_hot_add`, `memory_hot_add`, `nested_hv` | hot add, nested virtualization |
| `usb_controller` (`""`\|`usb2`\|`usb3`) | USB controller |
| `template` | convert to / from template |
| `add_disks[{size_gb,thin,datastore?}]`, `resize_disks[{key,size_gb}]`, `remove_disk_keys[]`, `delete_disk_files` | disks |
| `add_nics[{network,adapter_type}]`, `update_nics[{key,network?,start_connected?}]`, `remove_nic_keys[]` | network adapters |
| `add_cdroms[{iso_path}]`, `update_cdroms[{key,iso_path}]`, `remove_cdrom_keys[]` | CD/DVD drives (empty `iso_path` = no media) |
| `iso_path` | shortcut for the first CD/DVD drive (empty = remove it) |
